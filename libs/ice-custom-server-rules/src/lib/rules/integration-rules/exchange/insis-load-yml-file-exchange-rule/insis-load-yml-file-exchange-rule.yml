  InsisLoadYmlFileExchangeRule:
    description: >
      This is server Exchange rule capable of loading only static JSON or YML files. You should provide a relative path to a file,
      repo-folder will be used as a root folder to resolve the path. (example: [repo-foder] + 'data/myfile.json')
      The loaded files then will be passed inside the payload and transformation can be used
      in order to load the file into DataStore or IceModel. The payload pathto the files content is data.payload.file
    params:
      dataFileURL:
        label: File URL (JSON or YML)
        type: text
        required: true
        info: By default path to this files is constructed [repo]/[dataFileURL]
